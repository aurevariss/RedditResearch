# Reddit research project

## What it can do?
- Getting texts from reddit posts with urls and collect them in .txt file:
  - title
  - post body aka the post itself
  - all the comments (might work incorrectly with too long branches)
- Preparing texts for analysis:
  - get rid of punctuation
    - get rid of apostrophes (optional)
  - get rid of new lines, double spaces, tabs
  - get rid of numbers, emojis
  - lowering the case (optional)


## Future plans:
- More comfortably config setting
- Word frequency analisys
- Binome analysis
- Similarity analysis
- Topic modeling
